# planroom-journal
This repository contains journals of the progress, decisions, etc. on the planroom project.
It will be updated on a weekly basis for the duration of the Fall 2018 Academic Semester.

## Project Description
The planroom project is a web application to manage a construction company's bid process.
The bid process involves sharing digital blueprint files which are too large to email
with other companies (subcontractors). The planroom will manage the following aspects of the process:

*  Storing and providing access to blueprint files
*  Management and grouping of contacts for sending files
*  Email notifications to subcontractors regarding a project in the bid process.
*  Due dates related to each project being bid.
*  Which subcontractors plan to bid on a project.

## Project Components
*  [planroom-ui](https://github.com/mjsmith11/planroom-ui) - Vue.js front-end
*  [planroom-api](https://github.com/mjsmith11/planroom-api) - PHP back-end
